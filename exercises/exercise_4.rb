### Exercise 4: Loading a subset of stores

#1. Borrowing and modifying the code from Exercise one, create 3 more stores:

#- Surrey (annual_revenue of 224000, carries women's apparel only)
#- Whistler (annual_revenue of 1900000 carries men's apparel only)
#- Yaletown (annual_revenue of 430000 carries men's and women's apparel)

#2. Using the `where` class method from Active Record, fetch (a collection of) only those stores that carry men's apparel. Assign the results to a variable `@mens_stores`.
#3. Loop through each of these stores and output their name and annual revenue on each line.
#4. Do another fetch but this time load stores that carry women's apparel and are generating less than $1M in annual revenue.

# Your code goes here ...


Store.create(name:'Surrey', annual_revenue: 224000, mens_apparel: false, womens_apparel: true)
Store.create(name:'Whistler', annual_revenue: 1900000, mens_apparel: true, womens_apparel: false)
Store.create(name:'Yaletown', annual_revenue: 430000, mens_apparel: true, womens_apparel: true)

@mens_stores = Store.where(mens_apparel: true)
@mens_stores.each do |s|
  puts "#{s.name} #{s.annual_revenue}"
end

@womens_stores = Store.where(womens_apparel: true).where("annual_revenue < ?", 1000000)
@womens_stores.each do |s|
  puts "#{s.name} #{s.annual_revenue}"
end
