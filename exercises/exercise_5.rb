### Exercise 5: Calculations

#1. Output the total revenue for the entire company (all stores), using Active Record's `.sum` calculation method.
#2. On the next line, also output the average annual revenue for all stores.
#3. Output the number of stores that are generating $1M or more in annual sales. **Hint:** Chain together `where` and `size` (or `count`) Active Record methods.

# Your code goes here ...

puts Store.sum(:annual_revenue)
puts Store.sum(:annual_revenue) / Store.count
puts Store.where("annual_revenue >= ?", 1000000).count
