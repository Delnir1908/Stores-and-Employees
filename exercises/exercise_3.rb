### Exercise 3: Delete the third store

#1. Load the third store (into `@store3`) as you did the other two before.
#2. Using Active Record's `destroy` method, delete the store from the database.
#3. Verify that the store has been deleted by again outputting (`puts`ing) the `count` (as you did in Exercise 1.)

# Your code goes here ...

@store3 = Store.find(3)
@store3.destroy
puts Store.count
